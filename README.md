# Physics-Constrained Transformer for Motion Forecasting

**Author:** Ali Taheri

Vehicle trajectory forecasting on [Argoverse 2](https://www.argoverse.org/av2.html). Instead of
regressing raw `(x, y)` coordinates, the model predicts **control inputs** (acceleration, curvature)
that are integrated through a **differentiable kinematic bicycle model**, so every predicted
trajectory is kinematically drivable by construction.

The central experiment compares this physics-constrained decoder against an unconstrained coordinate
decoder on accuracy, trajectory feasibility, and data efficiency.

Full scope and timeline: [`VISION_PROJECT_SCOPE.md`](VISION_PROJECT_SCOPE.md).

## Status

Phase 1 (Setup & Data) — in progress. No model code yet.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.12: `av2` publishes macOS arm64 wheels for CPython 3.9–3.12 only, so Homebrew's
3.13/3.14 will not work.

```bash
brew install python@3.12
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Layout

```text
configs/preprocess.yaml   data paths and preprocessing parameters
src/config.py             config loading, data_root resolution
src/download.py           fetch scenarios from the public Argoverse S3 bucket
src/explore.py            measure and report the raw scenario format
src/preprocess.py         raw scenarios -> agent-centric tensors
src/visualize.py          scene plots, and visual validation of the frame transform
data/                     raw and preprocessed data (gitignored)
outputs/                  figures and results (gitignored)
```

The dataset does not live in the repo. `data_root` in `configs/preprocess.yaml` points at the
external SSD; override it without editing the config:

```bash
export AV2_DATA_ROOT=/some/other/path
```

## Downloading the data

Argoverse 2 motion forecasting is a public S3 bucket (no account needed). Measured sizes:

| Split | Scenarios | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| train | 199,908 | 47.0 GB |
| val | 24,988 | 5.9 GB |
| test | 24,984 | 4.1 GB |

```bash
brew install s5cmd
source .venv/bin/activate

python src/download.py --split val --limit 100      # quick sanity check (~25 MB)
python src/download.py --split val                  # full val, for evaluation
python src/download.py --split test                 # full test, for the leaderboard
python src/download.py --split train --limit 20000  # training subset (~4.8 GB)
```

Scenarios land in `<data_root>/raw/<split>/<scenario-id>/`. The script is resumable: re-running
skips anything already complete and verifies every scenario on disk before reporting `OK`. Without
`--limit` a whole split is fetched. The first run for each split lists the bucket and caches the
scenario ids under `<data_root>/raw/manifests/` (train takes a few minutes to list).

## Data

_Measured scenario format is recorded here in Step 4 (timesteps, sampling rate, observed/future
split, object types, map elements)._

## Results

_Baseline and model results tables land here in Phase 2 onward._
